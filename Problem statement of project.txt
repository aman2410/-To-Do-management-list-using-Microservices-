Problem Statement:

The application will be a super simple To-Do management list.

The whole application is divided into a set of services that specialize in doing a specific task using a simple set of protocols. 
All the communication between different services occurs over the network.

Now, for building our Application, we will be making use of  Spring. Our application uses Spring Boot as the framework for getting the basic things up. 
Currently, the application uses a few files in the JSON format which serves as the database for our application.

This application consists of two services namely the User service and the To-Do service:

 

1. User Service: The user service provides a RESTful endpoint to list the users in our application and also allows us to query the user lists based on their usernames. 
This service currently runs on port 5000 of our server.

2. To-Do Service: The ToDo service provides a RESTful endpoint to list all the lists as well as providing the list of projects filtered on the basis of usernames. 
This service runs on port 5001 of our server.

Note: Please follow all the best practices for designing Microservices with  Spring Boot.
